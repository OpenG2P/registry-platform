# End-to-end DCI search through the full PEP path:
#   partner signs the DCI envelope + an embedded consent JWS with its PM key ->
#   registry verifies the envelope (PM key) -> registry calls Consent Manager
#   /validate for the consent JWS -> registry renders each record through the
#   register's outgoing DCI template -> registry clamps the rendered record to
#   the consented scopes.
#
# The record searched for is the sanity farmer injected by the data-seed Job, so
# these assertions never depend on `dbSeed.loadSampleData` being on.
