#   registry verifies the envelope (PM key) -> registry calls Consent Manager
#   /validate for the consent JWS -> registry filters each internal record to
#   the consented data scopes' fields -> registry renders it through the
#   register's outgoing DCI template.
#
# The record searched for is the sanity record injected by the data-seed Job, so
# these assertions never depend on `dbSeed.loadSampleData` being on.
